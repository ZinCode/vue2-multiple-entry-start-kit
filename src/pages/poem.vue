        <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
        <article class="main">
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br> And sorry I could not travel both<br> And be one traveler, long I stood
            <br> And looked down one as far as I could <br> To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br><br> Then took the other,
            as just as fair, <br> And having perhaps the better claim, <br> Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br> Though
            as for that the passing there <br> Had worn them really about the same, <br><br> And both that morning equally
            lay <br> In leaves no step had trodden black. <br> Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br> Yet knowing how
            way leads on to way, <br> I doubted if I should ever come back. <br><br> I shall be telling this with a sigh
            <br> Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- <br> I took the one less traveled
            by, <br> And that has made all the difference. <br>
